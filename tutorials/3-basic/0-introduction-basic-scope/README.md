# Introduction to the Basic Scope 
In the **Basic Scope** of the mission, you will create an SAP Cloud Application Programming Model, or CAP-based Software as a Service (SaaS) application serving as a Material Dashboard. The Material Dashboard provides end-users with information on their company's open sales orders for materials supplied by the company, including availability information on the ordered materials in the company's plants.

The Material Dashboard application is composed of the following components:
- **CAP OData service** providing an OData V4 service which exposes data from 3 different SAP S/4HANA OData services.
- **SAP Fiori UI Application** providing the Material Dashboard UI displaying the data exposed by the CAP OData service. 

In the Basic Scope of the mission, you will use **SAP Business Application Studio** to develop and test the Material Dashboard. In addition, you will use **SAP Business Accelerator Hub** to import the required SAP S/4HANA OData service APIs, and its **sandbox** environemnt in order to consume the SAP S/4HANA data.
