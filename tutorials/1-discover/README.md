## Read about the Intelligent Enterprise process, Lead to Cash

Lead-to-Cash provides an end-to-end scenario, which manages all aspects of your experience, from the initial interaction to order fulfillment and service delivery. Drive and realize revenue along your journey. It is a template process based on best practices as well as common scenarios, and can be adapted or extended based on your specific requirements. The process may vary depending on the industry type, the type of customers and the sales channel used, whether e-commerce or direct sales.

This use case specifically looks at the Order to Cash component of the process and demonstrates how material availability from SAP S/4HANA is made available in SAP Cloud for Customer. It also shows how the same material availability can be provided as a downstream service, for example to distribution partners or other 3rd parties. We call this downstream service **Vendor Available to Promise (ATP)**.
